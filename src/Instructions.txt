INTRODUCTION:

Your goal in this game is to traverse the dungeons, 
killing  monsters and collecting treasure. You start 
at the dungeons' entrance, represented by 
the @ symbol. The · symbols represent open squares, 
the letters represent monsters, and other characters 
represent items sitting on the ground.

CHARACTER CREATION MENU:

Here you can create your hero by setting stats, 
race, and class.

*Strength: improves your damage with heavy weapons,
like maces, clubs, and long swords.Also increases 
your chance to stun an enemy.

like short swords and bows. Also increases 
your chance of a critical hit when attacking.

*Willpower: improves your starting MP and rate of
